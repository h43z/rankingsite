### Ranking Site
This was a very small 2 day javascript project to create a ranking site with live stats.
I wanted to play arround with server side rendering and mix it with
vue.js to learn how to use components and also utilize server side events
instead of websockets or just ajax.

###### Server
Node.js with express framework and pug templating and sqlite3 database and SSE.
###### Client
Vue.js
